# Word-Guessing-Game-Python-Pygame-
This project is a simple word guessing game (in the Hangman style) developed using Python and Pygame. The player tries to find the hidden word by guessing letters. As the number of incorrect guesses increases, the Hangman drawing is completed, and the result is displayed with a scoring system at the end of the game.
